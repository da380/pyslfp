    "# Tutorial 8 - Sobolev spaces on symmetric spaces\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we have seen that the Soblev space $H^{s}(\\mathbb{S}^{1})$ is implemented within the ```pygeoinf``` library. This Sobolev space comprises functions whose domain, $\\mathbb{S}^{1}$, is an example of a **symmetric space**. In broad terms, a symmetric space is a manifold where all the points are identical. A number of other common domains share this property, namely spheres in other dimensions, tori, and Euclidean space. On each of these domains it is possible to define Sobolev spaces in essentially the same manner and in a copmutationally efficient way. The sub-package ```symmetric_space``` includes implementations of these spaces in the following domains:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The one-sphere, $\\mathbb{S}^{1}$. Equvalently the one-torus, $\\mathbb{T}^{1}$.\n",
    "- The two-sphere, $\\mathbb{S}^{2}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the future implementations for $n$-torus for $n=2,3$ will be added. Note that Euclidean spaces can be approximated using the torus spaces so long as the functions have appropriate support. \n",
