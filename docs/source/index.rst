pysl:PySLFP: Python Sea Level Fingerprints 

`pyslfp` is a Python package for computing elastic sea level "fingerprints". It provides 
 a robust and user-friendly framework for solving the sea level equation, accounting for 
 the Earth's elastic deformation, gravitational self-consistency between the ice, oceans,
 and solid Earth, and rotational feedback effects.
