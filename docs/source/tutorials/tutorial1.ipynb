    "# Tutorial 1: Calculating a Basic Sea Level Fingerprint\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the first tutorial for `pyslfp`!\n",
    "\n",
    "A **sea-level \"fingerprint\"** is the unique, spatially variable pattern of sea-level change that results from the melting of a specific ice sheet or glacier. When an ice sheet loses mass, the water doesn't raise the sea level uniformly across the globe like adding water to a bathtub. Instead, a complex pattern emerges due to several key physical effects:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Gravitational Changes:** A large ice sheet exerts a significant gravitational pull on the surrounding water, pulling the sea level up locally. When the ice melts, this pull vanishes, causing the sea level to *fall* near the former ice sheet.\n",
    "* **Elastic Rebound:** The Earth's crust, which was depressed by the weight of the ice, elastically rebounds upwards after the ice is removed. This solid Earth motion further contributes to the sea-level fall in the near field.\n",
    "* **Rotational Changes:** The redistribution of mass from the pole to the global oceans slightly alters the Earth's rotation, which also has a distinct pattern of sea-level change.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will guide you through the process of calculating and plotting a classic sea-level fingerprint for a hypothetical scenario: the partial melting of the Northern Hemisphere's ice sheets."

A higher `lmax` allows for more detailed features but increases computational cost. For a global-scale problem like this, `lmax=256` provides a good balance of detail and performance; this value is also the default if `lmax` is not provided. "
