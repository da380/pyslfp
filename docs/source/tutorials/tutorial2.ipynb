    "\n",
    "This tutorial will cover four key topics:\n",
    "1.  **Defining Custom Loads:** Instead of using a helper for a whole hemisphere, we will create a more localized load, simulating the melt of a specific ice cap.\n",
    "2.  **Visualizing All Physical Outputs:** We will investigate all the physical fields returned by the solver: sea-level change, solid Earth displacement, and the different components of the gravity field.\n",
    "3.  **Exploring Solver Options:** We will examine the effect of **rotational feedbacks** (polar wander) on the sea-level solution.\n",
    "4.  **Advanced Initialization:** We will briefly discuss some of the optional parameters for the `FingerPrint` class, including how to use custom non-dimensionalization schemes."

    "It's important to note that all spatial fields in `pyslfp` (including loads, ice thickness, and the final results) are standard `pyshtools.SHGrid` objects. This means that while the library provides convenient helper functions like `disk_load`, you have the full power of the `pyshtools` library at your disposal. You can create `SHGrid` objects directly from NumPy arrays, spherical harmonic coefficients, or by loading external files, giving you complete flexibility to define any custom load you need.\n",

    "For this example, we'll first create a `SHGrid` object representing the *change in ice thickness* using the `disk_load` helper. We'll simulate a 100-meter thinning over a 5-degree radius disk centered on Greenland. We then use `direct_load_from_ice_thickness_change` to convert this into a physically correct surface mass load."
