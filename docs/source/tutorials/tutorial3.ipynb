    "# Tutorial 3: Reciprocity and Generalised Sea Level Forcing\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous tutorials, we explored how to compute sea-level fingerprints for a given surface mass load. In this tutorial, we will delve into a more fundamental physical property of the sea-level equation: **reciprocity**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reciprocity is a powerful concept in physics that relates the influence of a source at one point to the field measured at another. We will explore this concept and see how it leads to a more general way of thinking about the sea-level problem, where forces other than direct mass loads can be considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will cover:\n",
    "1.  **The Principle of Sea Level Reciprocity:** We'll explain the simple reciprocity relation for mass loads and demonstrate it with a numerical test.\n",
    "2.  **Generalised Forcing:** We will introduce three new ways to force the sea-level equation: an imposed surface displacement, an imposed gravitational potential change, and a change in the Earth's angular momentum.\n",
    "3.  **The Generalised Reciprocity Relation:** We will demonstrate the more complex reciprocity relation that holds true for this fully generalised problem."

The integral form states that the work done by one load on the sea-level field generated by another is symmetric:\n",

    "In this tutorial, we have confirmed that the `pyslfp` model satisfies both the simple and generalised sea-level reciprocity relations. The theory and its applications are discussed in detail in Al-Attar et al. (2023).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is more than just a mathematical curiosity. This property:\n",
    "* Serves as a powerful validation tool, confirming that our numerical implementation is physically self-consistent.\n",
    "* Is the theoretical foundation for **adjoint modelling**. The generalised forces we introduced are precisely the \"adjoint loads\" needed to efficiently calculate the sensitivity of certain measurements (like satellite gravity) to the ice-mass change.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a future tutorial, we will see how this reciprocity is elegantly handled by the `pygeoinf` operator formalism, and how it can be used to solve real-world inverse problems.\n",
