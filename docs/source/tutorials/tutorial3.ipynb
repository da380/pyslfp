    "# Tutorial 3: Reciprocity and Generalised Sea Level Forcing\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous tutorials, we explored methods for computing sea-level fingerprints for a given surface mass load. In this tutorial, we consider a fundamental physical property of the sea-level equation: **reciprocity**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reciprocity is a powerful concept in physics that relates the influence of a source at one point to the field measured at another. We will explore this concept and see how it leads to a more general way of thinking about the sea-level problem, where forces other than direct mass loads can be considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will cover:\n",
    "1.  **The Principle of Sea Level Reciprocity:** We'll explain the simple reciprocity relation for mass loads and demonstrate it with a numerical test.\n",
    "2.  **Generalised Forcing:** We will introduce three new ways to force the sea-level equation: an imposed surface displacement, an imposed gravitational potential change, and a change in the Earth's angular momentum.\n",
    "3.  **The Generalised Reciprocity Relation:** We will demonstrate the more complex reciprocity relation that holds true for this fully generalised problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "These results are key within adjoint modelling of sea level change, with this idea being vitial in the methods for solving associated inverse problems we discuss later. "
