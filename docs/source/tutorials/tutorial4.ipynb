    "# Tutorial 4: Adjoints and Sensitivity Kernels with `pygeoinf`\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous tutorials, we treated the `pyslfp` library as a tool for performing specific physical calculations. Now, we will explore its deep integration with the `pygeoinf` library, which provides the powerful mathematical abstractions that are useful in posing and solving associated inverse problems. \n",

    "We will show how the solution of the sea-level equation can be represented as a single **`LinearOperator`** object. This allows us to move beyond simple forward calculations and into the domain of operator algebra, adjoints, and sensitivity analysis.\n",

    "This tutorial will cover:\n",
    "1.  **The sea level eqiation as a `LinearOperator`:** Wrapping the solution of the elastic fingerprint problem into a `pygeoinf` operator.\n",
    "2.  **Reciprocity as the Adjoint Identity:** Revisiting the reciprocity principle from Tutorial 3 and demonstrating that it is equivalent to the mathematical \"dot-product test\" for an operator and its adjoint.\n",
    "3.  **Calculating Sensitivity Kernels:** Using the **adjoint method** to efficiently calculate the sensitivity of a sea-level measurement at a single point (e.g., Boston) to ice melt anywhere on the globe."

This is often a more physical choice than allowing infinitely rough loads. We must specify a smoothness `order` and a characteristic `scale`.\n",
    "* **Codomain:** The operator's codomain (output space) is a **`HilbertSpaceDirectSum`**. This is a composite space where each component corresponds to one of the physical outputs: [sea-level change, displacement, gravitational potential, angular velocity].

    "It is crucial to understand how to interpret this kernel correctly. Because our operator's domain is a **Sobolev space**, the resulting kernel `w` is also an element of that space. This means it represents the sensitivity functional with respect to the **Sobolev inner product**, not the standard $L^2$ inner product (a simple integral).\n",
    "\n",
    "The practical implication is that **a simple pointwise interpretation of the kernel's amplitude is not possible.** The influence of a given load pattern, $\\zeta$, on the sea level in Boston is given by the Sobolev inner product $ \\langle w, \\zeta \\rangle_{H^{s}(\\partial M)}$, which involves derivatives and penalizes roughness.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a subtle but important technical point that was knowingly simplified in Al-Attar et al. (2024). In that work, only $L^{2}$ inner products were used, but it was then necessary for the adjoint load for a point measurement to be smoothed to allow for a more intuitive visualization and to avoid numerical ringing. The kernel we have computed here is the more mathematically direct representation.\n",
    "\n",
