    "# Tutorial 5: A Bayesian Inverse Problem - Inferring Ice Melt from Tide Gauges\n",
    "\n",
    "In our previous tutorials, we have focused on the **forward problem**: predicting the Earth's response to a *known* change in ice mass. In this tutorial, we will tackle the more challenging **inverse problem**: inferring an *unknown* ice mass change from a set of sparse and noisy observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the full power of the `pyslfp` and `pygeoinf` libraries to solve this problem within a **Bayesian framework**. Instead of finding a single \"best-fit\" solution, the Bayesian method provides a full **posterior probability distribution**. From this, we can extract the **posterior expectation**, which represents our most likely estimate of the ice melt pattern. The full posterior distribution also characterises the uncertainty in our knowledge about the ice mass change. Methods exist within `pygeoinf`  for working practically with the full posterior distribution though their computational cost remains rather high. Here, we will instead use the posterior distribution to fully characterise our knowledge of the global mean sea level (GMSL) change."

Iterative methods, however, benifit massively from a good preconditioner being supplied, this being an operator that approximately solves the linear system, but whose action is relatively cheap to compute. \n",

Having done this, we can form the associated Bayesian inverse problem at the lower truncation degree and form its normal operator which is, of course, define on the same data space as our initial problem. The matrix form of this new normal operator can be computed explicitly at reasonable cost, and the action of its inverse determine cheaply by Cholesky factorising it and then performing back substitution for each new right hand side. In this manner we arrive at a reasonable preconditioner for the problem at hand. \n",

    "Comparison of the true and posterior mean ice thickness changes, along with the form of the pointwise standard deviation, suggests that while the tide gauge data can recover broadly correct features of the ice thickness change, it is not possible to recover fine spatial details. This is not surprising given the relative sparsity of the data and the fact that most tide gauges are located far from the polar regions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Despite this limitation, we can still investigate the extent to which certain average properties of the ice thickness change can be determined. First, we look at the estimated global mean sea level (GMSL) change. To do so, we set up, via a simple mass balance, a LinearOperator from the model space to resulting 1D property space. The model posterior measure can be pushed forward under this mapping, and we can then visualise the resulting distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that pushing forward the posterior measure to an n-dimensional space on which we determine the concrete form of the resulting covariance requires n additional solutions of the Bayesian normal equations. As a result, the calculation here will take a comparable time to that above for finding the full posterior expectation. "
