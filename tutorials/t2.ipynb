    "In this tutorial we consider again the calculation of sea level fingerprints, but now look into the various options along with the manner in which direct loads can be specified. \n",

    "### Setting up the FingerPrint class\n",
    "\n",
    "When setting up an instance of the ```FingerPrint``` class a number of options can be provided. These parameters are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ```lmax```: The truncation degree for spherical harmonics used within the calculations. The default value is 256.\n",
    "- ```length_scale```: The length-scale used for non-dimensionalisation. The default length scale is $1\\,$ metre.\n",
    "- ```mass_scale```: The mass-scale used for non-dimensionalisation. The default length scale is $1\\,$ kilogram.\n",
    "- ```time_scale```: The time-scale used for non-dimensionalisation. The default length scale is $1\\,$ second.\n",
    "- ```grid```: The form of the spatial grid chosen from the options for the ```pyshtools``` library. The default is ```\"DH\"```\n",
    "- ```love_number_file```: The path to a file containing the generalised Love numbers for use in the calculations. The default is a pre-calculated file for PREM of Dziewonski & Anderson (1981) with values up to 4096. This should be sufficient for most applications. "
